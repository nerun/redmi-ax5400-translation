This is an offline English translation for Xiaomi's Redmi AX5400 Gaming Router. It probably offers a better experience than live in-browser translation with Google Translate, because it doesn't break menus and buttons, and every translation was reviewed by a human.

### Caveats/disclaimers
* I have only a basic knowledge of JavaScript and wouldn't be able to have made this userscript without ChatGPT. As such, more experienced programmers might find the code badly designed. However, it seems to work.
* I don't understand Chinese. I made the translations with automatic translators (DeepL, Google Translate and Bing Translate) and selected what seemed the to be the best options, or rewrote to what I thought would be more natural, clearer, and use standard network terminology. Errors may still exist.
* I did my best to cover most use cases, but some strings might be missing a translation.
* This script was made for an AX5400 Gaming Edition and tested with that model, but it may work for other Xiaomi Routers. 

### Installation and use
1. Install a UserScript manager, such as [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. [Install our UserScript](https://github.com/virgilinojuca/redmi-ax5400-translation/raw/main/redmi-ax5400-en-translation.user.js) in your UserScript manager.
3. *(optional)* If needed, edit the code to include your router local IP.
4. *(optional)* If you're not getting translations when the page changes, edit the code to uncomment a button feature that can be clicked whenever you need to reapply the translation.
